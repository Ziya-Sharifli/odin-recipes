    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Rice</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the rice.

            Ugh, I know, rinsing is annoying, but it really is worth it to get rid of the dusty starches that may make
            the rice too sticky. Just place your rice in a fine mesh strainer and rinse under cold water until the water
            runs clear.
        </li>

        <li>Bring the water to a boil

            Then, stir in your rice and salt. And if you want to add a tab of butter, too, go for it â€” your rice will
            taste 10x better.
        </li>

        <li>Get a steady simmer.

            After adding the rice, the temperature of your water will drop significantly, and it'll stop boiling. Let it
            come back to a gentle simmer (otherwise you run the risk of your water cooking off faster than your rice
            gets tender).
        </li>

        <li>Check at 18 minutes.

            For long grain white rice, I always set a timer for 18, knowing that it could need another minute or two.
            Let the rice be your indicator, not the water. If there's a little water leftover, it's totally fine! Just
            tilt the saucepan slightly to drain it out. (Cooking brown rice? Check at 30
        </li>

        <li>Fluff it up!

            Use a fork to gently mix and lift rice to make sure that the grains don't stick together.
        </li>

    </ol>
